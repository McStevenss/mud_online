Tower game, 1v1 -> XvX

-10 floors, start at the top go downwards.
-First level is safe, each team has one floor to themselves
-Second floor possible to meet eachother.
-PVP
-classes and/or create own class STR,DEX,AGI... etc

-Class ideas:
	-Thickboi- 2x2 squares big, can special and remove blocks from the level (Miner)
	-Bathmaster, can throw cold buckets at enemies to freeze them (Brewmaster)
	-Bard, play guitarr. ex enemies who gets hit by the tunes get their controls reversed (Bard)
	-Warlock, have a minion follow them who does the physical fighting, warlock can only cast spells.
		-Optionally warlock can control their pet
	-Knight special to be able to block hallways with their sheilds so no-one can pass.

-Some sort of gameplay loop on each floor
-EX (either or):
	-[*]minions to kill for cash for shop
	-loot resources to build new weapons
	-random loot drops
	-[*]some sort of objective for the team to unlock their door down to the next level
		-(Teams can mess with eachother)
	-When one team goes down to the next floor the previous floor will start burning(ex battleroyale)
	-[*]Maybe each floor is just filled and they have to mine around to find the door down
		-This way they might run into eachother and have to fight in the mines
